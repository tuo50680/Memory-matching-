-Grid Indexing Error in mouseHandling
You are not correctly incrementing the row_index and col_index while iterating through the grid. Both remain 0, which causes all interactions to reference only the first row and column.
-Not Removing Matched Tiles
You set matched to True for a box when a pair matches, but the tiles do not visually disappear. This is because you're still drawing them in flipAnimation.
