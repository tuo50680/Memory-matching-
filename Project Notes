For making grid finalized on using nested for loops instead of nested lists (list inside of list)
Currently our 3x3 grid is not being stored inside of a list 


Populate rest of grid with sprite
Flipping
  -Try to make box disappear on click
Matching 
  -Detect sprites under each box 
  -If match, remove boxes 
  -If not match, cover boxes again 
End box
  -Assign to empty box

Try to get each sprite into own box
Match them (learning how to check he dictionary if flipped and allat

-Grid Indexing Error in mouseHandling
You are not correctly incrementing the row_index and col_index while iterating through the grid. 
Both remain 0, which causes all interactions to reference only the first row and column.
-Not Removing Matched Tiles
You set matched to True for a box when a pair matches, but the tiles do not visually disappear. This is because you're still drawing them in flipAnimation.

-Flipping 
-Putting sprites underneath boxes (list of lists). We had trouble being able to track if a sprite was underneath a box or not. To fix this, we made a free position list to keep track of all positions that did not have a sprite (and in the grid), and add a sprite.

-Correct timing of actions (likeeeeeeeee matching and mismatching)
-learned about enumerate and used it in the mouseHandling func which eliminates the need for an index counter and returns a tuple which made our code a little bit more effecient and helped elimate possible errors with incorrect index counting. This was important because the mouse clicks determined what actions the game would execute so less code meant it would be easier to debug problems instead of wasting time sifting line by line.

- We also used empty return statements to stop further code from executing when some condition were met. This was important because the empty return is returning "None" which is useful for a couple of reasons. For example if the user clicks a box then the clicked box condition is met, even if the user clicks again before the box is flipped the click wont process. We tracked the last two clicks for each attempt to determine if the sprites were a match or not, so we dont want to track the user clicking the same box twice because tracking the same box clicked 2x is unintended. 

-Order of code

-There was a lot of a code that we had to research, since we had no background in pygame so there are some parts of the code that we did not fully understand (like zip(images, freePositions)
